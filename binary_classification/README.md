## Description of the project

Modelling person's income based on the information about her/his education, marital status etc. 

I did data exploration to find correlations and the best features to build the model on.  
I also did data pre-processing including normalizing numerical features using MinMaxScaler and preprocessed the non-numeric features by one-hot encoding.

I tried several algorithms including AdaBoost and RandomForest Classifiers as well as Logistic Regression. 
I used grid search to find the best hyperparameters.

I used Accuracy and F-Score to evaluate the models and compare their performances.
