## Description of the project

Modelling person's income based on the information about her/his education, marital status etc. 

Data exploration was made to find correlations and the best features to build the model on.  
Data pre-processing included normalizing numerical features using MinMaxScaler as well as preprocessing the non-numeric features by one-hot encoding.

Several algorithms were tried, including Logistic Regression, AdaBoost and RandomForest classifiers. 
Grid search was used to find the best hyperparameters.

Accuracy and F-Score were the evaluation metrics to compare performance of the models.
