#### About this project


Supervised learning techniques should be applied in this challenge to the data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause.

#### About this notebook


This notebook will be structured in a following manner. 

First, data exploration will be made to find correlations and the best features to build the model on. Data pre-processing will include normalizing numerical features using MinMaxScaler as well as preprocessing the non-numeric features by one-hot encoding.

Next, several algorithms will be tried out, including Logistic Regression, AdaBoost and RandomForest classifiers. Grid search with cross validation will be used to find the best hyperparameters.

Accuracy and F-Score will be the evaluation metrics to compare performance of the models.
