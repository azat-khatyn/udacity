## Description of the project

Identifying customer segments applying unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German
households.

Data preprocessing was made with the focus on assessing missing data as in rows and columns, as well as handling categorical, numerical and mixed-type features.

A cleaning function was created to perform feature trimming and re-encoding.

Feature transformation was applied using Imputer and StandardScaler.

Dimensionality reduction was performed on the preprocessed data.

Clustering algorithm KMeans was used to segment customers. 

Many steps of the project were visualized using Seaborn library.
